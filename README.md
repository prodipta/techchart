# techchart

The goal of this R package (techchart) is to provide a comprehensive set of tools and methods for automated technical analysis. This includes trend analysis, automated support and resistance, technical pattern and technical formation identification.

## Installation

You can install from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("prodipta/techchart")
# this includes some codes in C++, and hence will require RTools (windows) or Xcode (Mac) and compilers/ libraries for building from source
```
## Example

Please see the package vignette (vignettes/techchart-vignette.Rmd) for detailed explanation and examples of the functionalities. Alternatively refer to <http://prodiptag.blogspot.com/2016/10/systematic-trading-r-package-for.html> for a discussion.
